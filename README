discodb
=======

An efficient, immutable, persistent mapping object.

Use the Makefile to build, e.g.::

    make
    make erlang
    make python
    make python CMD=install
    make utils

TODO:
 - remove nested functions to support clang (and asm.js?)
 - change `fscanf` in create.c, since its not cross-platform
 - ddb.flush()?
